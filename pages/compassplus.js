Even experienced riders may forget their compass card every now and then. The problem is that to learn how to use Translink, get a ticket or compass card, and fill up the funds of the card could sometimes be in different places. You would have to use different apps and go to different locations. Our app aims to solve that problem'

However, as designs and user testing progressed, I found that users much preferred a more Starbucks-styled card page, so I based the next design on that.'
