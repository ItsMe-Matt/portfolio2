Even experienced riders may forget their compass card every now and then. The problem is that to learn how to use Translink, get a ticket or compass card, and fill up the funds of the card could sometimes be in different places. You would have to use different apps and go to different locations. Our app aims to solve that problem'

This would allow experienced riders to continue using Translink without losing time in case they are missing their compass card or if they are going to a place they are not familiar with.

For the low fidelity, it felt really strange and clunky. I initially drew inspiration from other mobile payment apps like Apple Pay or Google Pay. However, as designs and user testing progressed, I found that users much preferred a more Starbucks-styled card page, so I based the next design on that.'

            description='As the designing progressed, another team member created their own version of my cards page, and after a vote and minor user testing, we decided to progress with their design instead. After that, I decided to move on to designing components. With designing components, there was once again a hand off and evolution of ideas and designs especially when we handed the designs over to the developers.'
